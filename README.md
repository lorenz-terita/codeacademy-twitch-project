# codeacademy-twitch-project

Twitch is the worldâ€™s leading video platform and community where millions of people and thousands of interests collide in a beautiful explosion of video games, pop culture, and conversation. Its live and on-demand video platform forms the backbone of a distribution network for video game broadcasters including professional players, tournaments, leagues, developers and gaming media organizations.

Part 1: Analyze Data with SQL
Part 2: Visualize Data with Matplotlib
